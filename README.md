Code needed to reproduce the examples in F. Yang and N. Matni, "Communication Topology Co-Design in Graph Recurrent Neural Network based Distributed Control"

The code in the folders `Utils` and `GS21` are from Dr. Fernando Gama and Dr. Somayeh Sojoudi and contains the code for their paper "Graph Neural Networks for Distributed Linear-Quadratic Control", which we used as a baseline. We thank them for sharing the code with us.

The experiments can be run from the file `script.py`.
